## Requirements:

### Part 1
* Get your local go env setup (follow instructions or ask questions)
* Create a `folder` called `whatever`, wherever you want to
* Create a file called `main.go` that prints out, wait for it... "Hello World" (Bet you din see that coming ðŸ˜‚)

### Part 2
* Create a new folder called `myMath` and create `math.go` or `main.go` within `myMath`
* Create a `func` within that file that you just created called `sum` (i'm setting you up for failure here ðŸ‘»)
* `sum` will take two params of type `int` and return an `int`
* Create a another file in the `root` directory of the project called `main.go`
* This `main.go` in the `root` will be where you declare `package main` which is the entrypoint for your program
* Now check the docs for `go mod` to init a new project (the hint is in the statement)
* Import `sum` from your package that you just created (this will not work)
* Cause `Sum`things work and `sum`things don't ðŸ˜‚ (another hint here)
* Your task is to find out why ðŸ˜‚ 


**You'll notice pretty soon that I din talk about any of this stuff, it was intentional I want you guys to ask questions and get
used to looking at the docs.**

Reach out to me if you have any questions. I'm hoping you will otherwise I shouldn't be teaching this course. ðŸ˜‚

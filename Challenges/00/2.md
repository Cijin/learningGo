## Part 1

* Using the short declaration operator declare two integers, and print them
* Use the `var` keyword to declare a struct, boolean, map. Then print their zero values

## Part 2
* Create a defined type called `Morph` with an underlying type of your choice. Then declare a variable, the same type as the underlying type of Morph. Check
  if the two values are equal. Use `Conversion` to convert Morph to the underlying type.
  
  Although we havnen't talked about `Conversion`. [This doc](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Conversions) should set you on your way. 
  Keep in mind conversion is not the same as casting.
